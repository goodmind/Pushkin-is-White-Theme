# Pushkin is White Theme

The life is dark so is the font  
There must be something like a bond  
You hear the screaming late at night?  
It is the numbers, letters fight  
The civil war between the curves  
The round figures ain't show remorse  
Is it poetically correct  
To use a war-torn alphabet?  
My fingers fly across the keys  
Can someone stop me writing please.
